## About Me
Hi, I'm Lucy. She/Her. I make small games and websites. I started coding on Scratch in 2013, and I am experienced in Python, JavaScript, HTML+CSS, and Java. Little experience in C#, C++, and Ruby. I also have experience in digital art and graphic design, video and photo editing, 3D and 2D animation, and wiki editing. Always learning new skills and languages. Contact me LucyA#0919 on Discord.

<!-- I also love backpacking, music, and activism (specifically feminism and animal rights)! -->
